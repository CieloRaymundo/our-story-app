  <h1>Our Story</h1>
  <p>
    This platform is built for those who come from immigrant backgrounds from all around the world. Our purpose is to help you tell your story, your struggles, your accomplishments everything that comes with being/having an immigrant background. There are a lot of struggles we go through as a community but we also have so many achievements. There is so much more to us that people don't realize. We are so much more than what people think. Our struggles and achievements made US.
